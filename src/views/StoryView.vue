    <h1 class="mt-10">Hello!</h1>
    <h2>My name is Hermes.</h2>

    <p>
      I am a software engineer from Athens, Greece. When it comes to programming, there is no type
      of education I haven't had: I was university-educated, then became (and continue to be)
      self-taught, and also attended a bootcamp for good measure.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am sort of a Computer Science prodigal son. My first degree was a Bachelor of Science in
      Computer Science at the University of Essex, in the UK. I then moved on to post-graduate
      studies with a Master of Science in Human-Computer Interaction at KTH, the Royal Institute of
      Technology, in Sweden.
    </p>

    <p>
      That degree took me down a different path where I diverged from programming in particular and
      even Computer Science in general. There was cognitive and social science, philosophy, and even
      some elements of design to what I did. I then began a doctorate degree at Stockholm University
      where I combined my already interdisciplinary studies with even more subjects, such as
      didactics, conceptual change, and the study of virtual humans in different applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don't regret my studies or my time spent working as a teaching assistant and a researcher. I
      broadened my horizons, learned even more about learning (both in terms of my research and from
      personal experience) and I had the chance to meet and work with some wonderful people.
    </p>

    <p>
      That being said, I found out that becoming an academic wasn't really a dream of mine, and I
      had to bid my coworkers and supervisors farewell. After trying out a few jobs, I decided to
      teach myself how to code again: to remember what I had forgotten and learn new things as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      I started to follow the free and open curriculum of The Odin Project. I was happy with my
      progress and became increasingly interested in trying out different languages and
      technologies. Shortly after starting with this program, however, I had an unfortunate health
      issue, which pushed my progress back by about a year.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the midst of my recovery, when I was feeling strong and healthy enough, I decided to attend
      a programming bootcamp. I saw this program called Social Hackers Academy and decided to apply
      to their Front-End Development program.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program itself used a curation of open curriculums in combination with live teaching
      sessions and custom challenges and assignments set to us by our instructors. We were also
      assigned mentors who supported our learning even further, both in a practical sense, through
      team code challenges and prep, as well as psychologically, by encouraging us and giving us
      valuable feedback.
    </p>

    <p>
      I graduated from Social Hackers Academy having finished multiple projects and assignments, a
      sample of which you can find in my <RouterLink to="/code">code portfolio</RouterLink>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In May of 2022, I began working for Suite5, an Information Technology Solutions and Services
      company. I began as a front-end software engineer, but through my experience there I have not
      only learned more about the front-end; I have also begun expanding towards the back-end,
      bringing me closer to my goal of being a full-stack web developer.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-8">This brings us to today.</h2>

    <p>
      Nowadays I continue to learn, expand my knowledge, skills and responsibilities, and grow my
      portfolio while working with interesting projects, as well as with knowledgeable and kind
      colleagues.
    </p>

    <p>
      I thrive in environments where my skills, creativity and thirst for learning find fertile
      ground. I love working with people who are as passionate as I am and who can teach me
      different ways of thinking and seeing the world, both through our craft and outside of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you came here wanting to collaborate with me or just to talk shop, please don't hesitate to
      reach out to me through my social links, which you can find on the
      <RouterLink to="/">main page</RouterLink>. Thank you for wanting to know more about me and I
      hope to meet you soon!
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-8">OK, sure, but what else?</h2>

    <p>
      You want to know even more about me? You flatter me! OK, I'll indulge your curiosity. We're
      all more than just one thing, after all, and more than just our chosen profession.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am a big fan of polymathy and opsimathy. On days when I feel more charitable with myself
      than not, I fancy myself somewhat of a Renaissance man. I love to learn, to create, to tinker
      and to discover. I love science, technology, art and philosophy, and I try to find myself in
      places where they intersect.
    </p>

    <p>
      I play and compose different genres of music, and I also write lyrics and poetry. I have
      written, directed and edited a short documentary which was the result of a beginner's seminar
      and would love to explore more filmmaking experiences. I also dabble in photography and
      graphic design every now and then, and I would love to pursue more opportunities to learn how
      to draw, paint and illustrate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another big passion of mine is language (in the scientific / literary sense), and languages,
      plural. I myself am an early successive bilingual, speaking English and Greek at a maternal
      level. I also speak a little Swedish and have forgotten a lot of French from school. Other
      than English, my favorite foreign language is Japanese. I have an elementary diploma in it but
      want to continue learning it and improve in the future, as I love Japanese culture and am
      interested in a lot of art and media from Japan.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love animals and have had pets all my life - from dogs and parakeets to sea turtles and
      hamsters. I grew up with a dog, but am now more of a cat person. I am a cat father of one
      special boy but I try to make friends with all the kitties I meet on the street.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think that about covers it! Thank you so much for taking the time to get to know me. Maybe
      you'll allow me the pleasure of meeting you.
